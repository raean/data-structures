# Data Structures & Algorithms:
## This repository is home to all my own implementations of data structures and various algorithms in an attempt to practice concepts first-hand.

### Currently, you will find the following data structures:
1. Binary Search Trees
   * Insertions / deletions
   * Contain check
   * Finding the minimum / maximum nodes
   * In-order, pre-order and post-order print
   * Highest common root between two nodes
   * Longest path between two nodes
  
### And, the following algorithms:
1. Fibonacci (3 ways):
    * Recursive Approach
    * Memo-ized Approach
    * Bottoms Up Approach
